# Install EPICS v7 on Raspberry Pi (40 minutes)
By following these instructions, you will build and install EPICS 7 on your Raspberry Pi.

EPICS 7 provides the base infrastructure for EPICS, upon which further EPICS packages like StreamDevice can be built.

## References

## Pre-requisites
* Capability to SSH into your Raspberry Pi
* Working internet connection for your Raspberry Pi

## Materials
* Local area network
* Laptop / computer, connected to local area network
* Raspberry Pi, connected to local area network

## Steps

### SSH into your Raspberry Pi

Follow the prior instructions for this.

### Bring the OS fully up-to-date (15 minutes)

From your SSH terminal window, bring all software on the Raspberry Pi fully up-to-date. This is best practice before installing required dependencies. Here's how:


Ensure your Raspberry Pi has a working internet connection.

Then, bring your Raspberry Pi OS up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Note: The `-y` lets you skip typing "yes" to prompts.

Plan for about fifteen minutes of downloading and installing software upgrades on your first boot.

### Install relevant EPICS dependencies (5 minutes)

Ensure your Raspberry Pi has a working internet connection.

Then, install basic build tools (the *build-essential* package includes key development tools like gcc and perl) and *git* (for package management).

```bash
sudo apt -y install build-essential
sudo apt -y install git
```

#### Optional Checks
(Optional) Install networking tools, including nmap, netstat, and ifconfig:

```bash
sudo apt -y install net-tools
```
    
(Optional) Confirm GNU make is of version 3.81 or higher

```bash
make --version
```
    
What I found installed was "GNU Make 4.2.1" at the time of this tutorial.
    
(Optional) Confirm that perl is version 5.8.1 or higher:

```bash
perl --version
```
    
What I found installed was Perl "v5.28.1" at the time of this tutorial.
    
(Optional) Check that "readline" is installed (it is.)
    
```bash
apt search readline-common
```
    
What I found installed was readline version 7.0-5 at time of writing this tutorial.
    
### Download and install EPICS v7 (30 minutes)
This portion of our instructions are copied nearly directly from the [EPICS 7 getting started guide](https://docs.epics-controls.org/projects/how-tos/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html).

#### Download and install
Create an EPICS folder, download the latest repository code, and compile EPICS base from source:
 
```bash
mkdir $HOME/EPICS
cd $HOME/EPICS
git clone --recursive https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base.git
cd epics-base
make -j8
```

(Note: the `make -j8` means to compile EPICS using eight threads, to speed up this step on a multicore machine. A more bulletproof method is to just run `make`, which uses one thread, and may take longer.)

#### Configure your user profile
Append the following environment variable declarations to your the last lines of `.bashrc` file, which is located in your home directory (a.k.a. your `~` directory.) For example, open `~/.bashrc` using the `nano` text editor: `nano ~/.bashrc`, then scroll to the end and add these lines below.

```bash
# EPICS Environment Variables
export EPICS_BASE=${HOME}/EPICS/epics-base
export EPICS_HOST_ARCH=$(${EPICS_BASE}/startup/EpicsHostArch)
export PATH=${EPICS_BASE}/bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}:${PATH}
```
    
The variables aren't yet updated in your system. You have two options to load the variables you just wrote into your `~/.bashrc` file.

1. Option 1: Close the SSH window, and then SSH back into your Pi a second time.
2. Option 2: Run the command `source ~/.bashrc` and skip closing/re-opening your SSH window.

### Step back and tinker!
You can now build local EPICS databases and use commands like "softIoc" and "caget"! Tinker around with these commands for a little while by following the online tutorial ["Test EPICS"](https://docs.epics-controls.org/projects/how-tos/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#test-epics).

## What's Next?

Now that EPICS v7 is installed, let's test it by creating your first IOC:

**Next tutorial:** [Create and Run a Simple EPICS IOC](../simple-ioc/build-run-simple-ioc.md) - Build and test a basic IOC to verify your EPICS installation

After confirming your IOC works, you'll be ready to integrate hardware devices and build more complex distributed systems.
