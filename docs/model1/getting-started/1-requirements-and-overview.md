# Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up two Raspberry Pi devices with SSH access for remote development. You'll complete hardware setup, network configuration, OS installation, and initial system access.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

### Hardware Requirements
- 2x Raspberry Pi devices (Model 3 B+ or newer recommended)
- 2x MicroSD cards (16GB minimum, Class 10 recommended)

### Software Requirements
- Administrative access to your router's configuration page
- Basic familiarity with SSH connections
- Raspberry Pi OS Imager software

### Network Access
- Administrative login credentials for your wireless/wired router
- Internet connection for downloading updates

## Completion Criteria

You will know you have successfully completed this setup when:

1. **Hardware/Ethernet Setup**: Both Raspberry Pis are physically connected to your network via Ethernet cables
2. **WiFi Configuration** (Optional): Devices can connect via WiFi as backup/alternative
3. **SSH and Flashing**: Both Pi devices are flashed with OS and accessible via SSH from your laptop
4. **System Updates**: Both devices are fully up-to-date with the latest software packages
